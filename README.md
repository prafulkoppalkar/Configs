# Hi there, I'm Praful Koppalkar 👋 

Hello! I'm Praful and I thrive on crafting things that live on the internet. My journey in web development began back in 2021 when I was a fresher. 
Designing responsive websites taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege of working in diverse domains, including medical insurance and fintech startups, one of them being a major corporation. 
My primary focus revolves around building accessible, easily integratable SDKs, user-friendly products, and digital experiences at Juspay for a wide array of clients.
