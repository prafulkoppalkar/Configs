# Hi there, I'm Praful Koppalkar ðŸ‘‹

I build things for the web.
I'm a software engineer specializing in creating exceptional digital experiences. 
Currently, I'm focused on building accessible, human-centered products at [Juspay](https://www.juspay.in/).

## About Me

Hello! I'm Praful and I thrive on crafting things that live on the internet. My journey in web development began back in 2021 when I was a fresher. 
Designing responsive websites taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

Fast-forward to today, I've had the privilege of working in diverse domains, including medical insurance and fintech startups, one of them being a major corporation. 
My primary focus revolves around building accessible, easily integratable SDKs, user-friendly products, and digital experiences at Juspay for a wide array of clients.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React.js
- Python
- HTML/CSS
- ReScript
- Tailwind


### Here are some of my highlighted projects:

- [Netflix Clone](https://netflix-v101.netlify.app/) 
- [MIT Scratch Clone](https://scratch-playground.netlify.app/)
- [Speechify App](https://speak-with-me-v101.netlify.app/)
